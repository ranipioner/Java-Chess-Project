# Chess System

A console-based chess game developed in Java. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles through the implementation of a complete chess game, including piece movement rules, game state management, and a simple text-based interface.
This project was made through Nelio Alves's Udemy Course "Java COMPLETO Programação Orientada a Objetos + Projetos"  @acenelio (Github)

## Features

- Full chess match simulation
- Move validation according to official chess rules
- Check and checkmate detection
- Object-oriented architecture
- Console-based UI with colored board representation
- Custom exceptions for error handling

## How to Run

1. **Requirements**:
   - Java JDK 8 or higher
   - Any IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ) or command-line terminal

2. **Steps**:
   - Clone or download this repository
   - Open the project in your IDE or compile manually using:
     ```bash
     javac src/application/Program.java
     java application.Program
     ```

## Example Gameplay

After running, the console will show a chessboard. Players will be prompted to input their moves using standard algebraic notation (e.g., `e2` to `e4`). The game alternates turns and shows the updated board after each move.

## Educational Purpose

This project was developed as part of an OOP learning path. It demonstrates:

- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Modular programming
- Exception handling
- Clean architecture practices
